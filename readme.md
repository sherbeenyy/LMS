# LMS – Library Management System API

## Overview

The **Library Management System (LMS)** API is a backend application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It allows libraries and bookshops to manage:

- Books (inventory, sales, prices)
- Customers
- Sales receipts
- Identify top 5 best-selling books

It follows a secure, layered architecture and includes **Swagger API documentation**, **JWT authentication**, and **professional test coverage using Jest & Supertest**.

## Architecture & Request Lifecycle

The project uses **layered architecture** to ensure scalability, testability, and modularity.

### Request Flow

```
Client → Middleware → Validation → Route Handler → Database → Response
```

### Database Desgin

## Authentication & Middleware

### JWT Middleware

All sensitive routes are protected using **JWT-based middleware**.

Example:

```

Authorization: Bearer <your_token>

```

- If the token is valid → access granted
- If invalid or missing → returns `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`

### Request Validation

All route inputs are validated using **Joi** schemas (e.g., `bookValidator.js`, `receiptValidator.js`) before hitting the business logic.

If the validation fails, a helpful message is returned early.

---

## API Documentation

All routes are documented using **Swagger (OpenAPI v3)** and grouped by category:

- `/books` → Book management
- `/customers` → Customer operations
- `/receipts` → Receipt management
- `/auth` → User login/register
- `/receipts/bestsellers` → Bestsellers report

### Access Swagger UI

After starting the server, go to:

```

http://localhost:{port}/api-docs

```

You’ll be able to explore all APIs, test them live, and view detailed schemas.

---

## Testing

All endpoints are covered with **Jest** and **Supertest**.

### Coverage Includes:

- Auth (register/login with hashed passwords)
- CRUD operations for:
  - Books
  - Customers
  - Receipts
- Token-based access control
- Edge cases (e.g., duplicate entries, insufficient stock, invalid IDs)

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Or run an individual file:

```bash
npx jest __test__/book.test.js
```

---

## Local Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm or yarn

### 2. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sherbeenyy/LMS.git
cd LMS
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lms
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

And Swagger docs at:

```
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```
